The community has already taken significant steps in this direction, with convolutional neural nets (CNNs) becoming the common workhorse behind a wide variety of image prediction problems. CNNs learn to minimize a loss function – an objective that scores the quality of results – and although the learning process is automatic, a lot of manual effort still goes into designing effective losses. In other words, we still have to tell the CNN what we wish it to minimize. But, just like Midas, we must be careful what we wish for! If we take a naive approach, and ask the CNN to minimize Euclidean distance between predicted and ground truth pixels, it will tend to produce blurry results [29, 46]. This is because Euclidean distance is minimized by averaging all plausible outputs, which causes blurring. Coming up with loss functions that force the CNN to do what we really want – e.g., output sharp, realistic images – is an open problem and generally requires expert knowledge.
