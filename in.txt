Conditional GANs We are not the first to apply GANs
in the conditional setting. Previous works have conditioned
GANs on discrete labels [28], text [32], and, indeed, images. The image-conditional models have tackled inpainting [29], image prediction from a normal map [39], image
manipulation guided by user constraints [49], future frame
prediction [27], future state prediction [48], product photo
generation [43], and style transfer [25]. Each of these methods was tailored for a specific application. Our framework
differs in that nothing is application-specific. This makes
our setup considerably simpler than most others.
Our method also differs from these prior works in several architectural choices for the generator and discriminator. Unlike past work, for our generator we use a “U-Net”-
based architecture [34], and for our discriminator we use a
convolutional “PatchGAN” classifier, which only penalizes
structure at the scale of image patches. A similar PatchGAN architecture was previously proposed in [25], for the
purpose of capturing local style statistics. Here we show
that this approach is effective on a wider range of problems,
and we investigate the effect of changing the patch size.
